I have 3+ years of development experience working along with multiple javascript frameworks and Angular 2+ (predominantly), At the initial stages I was working as a freelance ui developer for small startups, Where I was involved in developing clean reusable ui components.

Then I started working with gymday as a full time front end developer where I got exposure to work with large scale products which are gymday crm, gymday business app, studioyou crm , studioyou web app and webstore.

My core role with gymday is to build features for studioyou such as calendar, pos, scheduling, notifications, auto messages, reports, payments (recurring) and uprgrading entire product from angular 2 to 8.

The framework and library I am currently working with are angular2+, react and gatsby.
